# Roland-Modela-Control
This python program allows control of Roland Modela MDX-15 desktop CNC milling machine.

Allows for:
- Moving the mill around
- Setting the Z Zero
- Sending .prn files to the mill
- Pausing and stopping the mill

This program does not get any feedback from the mill, so it is possible that the coordinates shown in the program are not related to the actual location of the milling bit.  This is especially true after a program has been sent.  It it recommended to reset the z-zero and home the mill if you are unsure.
